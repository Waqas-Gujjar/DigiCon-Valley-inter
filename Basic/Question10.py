# Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height.
base = int(input('Enter a base of triangle: '))
height = int(input('Enter a height of triangle: '))
area = base*height
print(f"the area of triangle is {area}")

# output
# Enter a base of triangle: 10
# Enter a height of triangle: 90
# the area of triangle is 900
